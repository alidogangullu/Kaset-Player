### Local Pairing Server (TV Link)

Because Android TV lacks a convenient keyboard, this app uses a dedicated **pairing flow**:

1. The TV app starts a **built-in local web server**.
2. User goes to the TV's IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:8080/tv`) on a phone.
3. User signs in via Apple MusicKit JS on the mobile browser.
4. The token is sent back to the TV instantly.
